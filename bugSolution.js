```javascript
//MyComponent.jsx
<div className="bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">My Component</h2>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
The solution is to check and correct the following:

1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Verify that the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) is correctly configured and includes the necessary paths for your CSS files.
2. **CSS Specificity:** If you have other CSS rules that target the same element, make sure that the Tailwind CSS classes have sufficient specificity to override them. You might need to add a more specific selector or increase the specificity of your Tailwind CSS classes.
3. **Conflicting Styles:** Check for any conflicting styles from other CSS files or inline styles that could be interfering with the Tailwind CSS classes. Try adding `!important` to your Tailwind CSS classes to force them to override other styles (use with caution).
