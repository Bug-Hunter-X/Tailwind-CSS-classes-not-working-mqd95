```javascript
//MyComponent.jsx
<div className="bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">My Component</h2>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a div element. However, the `bg-gray-200` class is not working as expected, and the background color is not changing.
