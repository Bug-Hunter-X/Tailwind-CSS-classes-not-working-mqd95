# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS: classes not working as expected. In this specific example, the background color of a div element does not change despite using the `bg-gray-200` class. This could be due to several reasons, including:

* Incorrect or missing Tailwind CSS configuration.
* CSS specificity issues.
* Conflicting styles.

The repository contains two files: `bug.js` (demonstrates the bug) and `bugSolution.js` (provides a solution).

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the project.
4. Observe that the background color of the div element does not change.
